# Task Manager
A simple task manager app built using React and Redux. 

### Note:
- This project uses Vitejs as the front end build tool.
- The project was bootstrapped using the command `npm init vite`
- This app works exactly same as the [React task Manager](https://github.com/aayush301/React-task-manager/) except the fact that this one uses Redux store for state management in contrast to the other one which simply uses React's Context API + useContext hook + useReducer hook for the same.
